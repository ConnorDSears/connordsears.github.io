			<p>At Oryx Advertising Co. in Doha, Qatar, I contributed to several of the firm&#39;s monthly and bimonthly titles, including <em>Qatar Today</em>, <em>Campus</em>, and <em>T Qatar</em>. While in Doha, I covered many different industries, including food, sports, business and education.</p>

			<p>I have worked as a contributing writer for <a href="http://www.onlysp.com/author/csears/" target="_blank">OnlySP.com</a> and <a href="http://www.gamenguide.com/reporters/connor-sears" target="_blank">GameNGuide.com</a>, two daily news sites specializing in video game coverage. At GameNGuide, I was also able to cover the technology and gadget industry. Though much of my work was putting up daily news posts, I did get the chance to write a couple of feature stories for OnlySP, like the examples below.</p> 
			<p>As a freelancer, I pitched and wrote a story for Polygon about a young but successful game developer in Doha, Qatar.</p>

			<p>Though my time at the award-winning student publication <a href="http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/author/ConnorSears/" target="_blank">North by Northwestern</a> was largely spent as an editor, I did occasionally get to write in-depth articles on several campus issues. I also spent several months as one of the publication&#39;s news editors, and I would frequently cover news stories when our writing staff was stretched thin.</p>
